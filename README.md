# hello! i'm andy. ðŸ‘‹
I am a human being, high-school student, and wannabe stuff maker. At least, when I'm not procrastinating. Or sleeping. Or both.

## ðŸ”­ iâ€™m currently working on
I'm continuing work on an [incremental game](https://github.com/AndyThePie/pencil-to-pluto) made originally for a game jam. And also a [Discord bot](https://github.com/AndyThePie/slabbot). A lot of stuff outside of the code world, though,

## ðŸŒ± iâ€™m currently learning
A lot. It's summer. Messing around a bit with **C#** and **JavaScript**. (I should probably figure out TypeScript some day, it sounds cool...)

## ðŸ“« how to reach me:
You can reach me through Discord (@AndzCLiv3#7664), or preferrably email me. Although I have no clue why you'd need to.

## âš¡ fun fact:
Uhh... hermit crabs are not true crabs...?<sup>[_citation needed_]</sup>
