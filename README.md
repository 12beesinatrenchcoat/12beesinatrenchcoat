# hello! i'm andy. ðŸ‘‹
I am a human being, high-school student, and wannabe stuff maker. At least, when I'm not procrastinating. Or sleeping. Or both.

## ðŸ”­ iâ€™m currently working on
~~Probably~~ a lot of schoolwork. 
Oh, and also [slabbot](https://github.com/AndyThePie/slabbot) - a Discord bot that really has no reason to exist. But it's fun to work on!

## ðŸŒ± iâ€™m currently learning
Whatever the current topic is in school. 

## ðŸ“« how to reach me:
You can reach me through Discord (@AndzCLiv3#7664), or email me. Although I have no clue why you'd need to.

## âš¡ fun fact:
Uhh... hermit crabs are not true crabs...?<sup>[_citation needed_]</sup>
